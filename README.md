===========

Environment Choosing
-----------------------

[Stable baselines](https://readthedocs.org/projects/stable-baselines/downloads/pdf/master/) is recommended as a improvement of OpenAI.

Setup
-----

- Before starting, using Virtual Environment is highly recommended.
- Note: Baselines requires python3 (>=3.5)

### Preparation of Virtual Environment and Python3
Please refer the complete [guide](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/).

Example using virtualenv and default interpreter python2.7
--

`brew install python3`

Create a virtual environmet named python3 under `{your_folder}/virtualenv`
